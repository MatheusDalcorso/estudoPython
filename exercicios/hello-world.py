# import this

# The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

# Beautiful is better than ugly.
# Explicit is better than implicit.
# Simple is better than complex.
# Complex is better than complicated.
# Flat is better than nested.
# Sparse is better than dense.
# Readability counts.
# Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
# Although practicality beats purity.
# Errors should never pass silently.
# Unless explicitly silenced.
# In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
# There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
# Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
# Now is better than never.
# Although never is often better than *right* now.
# If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
# If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
# Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

# print("          hello, world!        ".title().strip())

# for i in "          hello, world!        ".title().strip():
#     print(i, end='')
    #o 'end' modifica o funcionamento do print, que por padrão pula de linha depois de imprimir.
    # No caso do "end=''" ele coloca uma string vazia depois de imprimir ao invés de pular uma linha.
    # Colocando "end='!'" a frase ficaria assim -> H!e!l!l!o!,! !W!o!r!l!d!!!

print('Hello, world!')
